# Save It!
Hack UIowa project - a chatbot for slaying personal savings goals

<h4>US savings rate in decline</h4>
According to FRED data, personal savings as percent of DPI (that is, how much people save as a percentage of their after-tax income) was 3.5% in July 2017.
The average savings rate over the past 58 years is 8.3% of DPI, over the last 10 years we saved an average of 5.5%. Today's low savings rate, especially given our relative economic strength, is a cause for concern.
Conventional wisdom, [such as this article from TIAA](https://www.tiaa.org/public/offer/insights/starting-out/how-much-of-my-income-should-i-save-every-month), suggests 20% as a responsible personal savings rate.

<h4>Save It! "Nudges" towards saving more<h4>
“A nudge, as we will use the term, is any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.”

― Richard H. Thaler, Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness

Through both a website and convenient text messaging interface, Save It! makes it easy to set and track savings goals until you have enough socked away to buy anything ... even your own castle.

<h4>The website</h4>
The website is hosted on GitHub pages, so you cannot actually interact with the chatbot. View the design [here](GRIFFIN)
