          <p>According to FRED data, personal savings as percent of DPI (that is, how much people save as a percentage of their after-tax income) was 3.5% in July 2017.</p>
          <p>The average savings rate over the past 58 years is 8.3% of DPI, over the last 10 years we saved an average of 5.5%. Today's low savings rate, especially given our relative economic strength, is a casue for concern.<p>
          <p>Conventional wisdom, such as <a href="https://www.tiaa.org/public/offer/insights/starting-out/how-much-of-my-income-should-i-save-every-month" class="black-text">this article from TIAA,</a> suggests 20% as a responsible personal savings rate.</p>
